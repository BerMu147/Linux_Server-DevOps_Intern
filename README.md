### DEVOPS INTERNSHIP PROGRAM

This repository represents the stuff I did as a DevOps Intern on my internship program and development.
Repository has been kept private for over 2 years since I didn't have permission to expose it publically.
Now it's finally here with all the examples and work that has been done.

The structure of Cluster is complex but I have done a lot of edits and effort to make it as simple as possible
Services that can be found within are:
- Dockerfiles for Fronted and Backend CI/CD
- Graylog - Logging Management Service (using MongoDB as database and ElasticSearch for searching)
- Grafana - Monitoring Service
- Traefik - Load Balancer and Reverse Proxy service
- RabbitMQ - Message Broker
- SignalR - WebApplication for .NET application
- Node Exporter - Machine resources (memory, CPU, disk)
- Prometheus - System Monitoring and Alerting Toolkit
- Shell scripts like .bashsrc, .profile, service.sh (Traefik update)

Feel free to sniff around and use the examples for your own dev configuration!
